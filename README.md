idk how importing works for bluestacks
BLUESTACKS ONLY

Merge the  macros in this order (recommended)
Loop cruiseblock one time
Loop ad1 five times
Loop ad2 three times
Loop ad3 one time
Loop ad5 one time
Loop ad4 five times
Loop ad5 one time
Loop cruiseblock one time

Watches pretty much every single ad in the game
Does NOT watch the following: Coupling, Merit, Heaven sect, Rift, Earth sect (greeting and promotion), Praise land, Fortune land
Encounter, Alliance Affair, Monthly Event, Fishing.

DOES WATCH THE FOLLOWING
20x Nochi pack
15x Primordial pack
8x Boutique
8x Topup
8x Talisman
5x Spiritual Mountain (10 total)
3x Extra Wine attempts (BREWS STRENGTH NORMAL WINE)
3x Spirit pool (Celestial stones)
8x every market refresh

BEFORE RUNNING THE MACRO, USE SKIP TICKETS ON COUPLING, MERIT, EARTH SECT GREETING, MONTHLY EVENT, ALLIANCE AFFAIR, FISHING IF F2P, then whatever you want. 

EXIT AND REENTER HEAVEN, THEN WAIT A FEW SECONDS BEFORE STARTING THE MACRO. Cruiseblock will shield beast cruise for the duration of the macro, then unshiel after done.

IF YOU HAVE SHIELD BEAST CRUISE ON BY DEFAULT don't add the cruiseblock macro

MACRO TAKES AROUND 1 HOUR 30 MINUTES TO FINISH

TRY TO HAVE SOMETHING OPEN IN THE BACKGROUND SO THE COMPUTER DOES NOT FALL ASLEEP, FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THE MACRO WILL MISS 1 AD IF IT FALLS ASLEEP
SUGGESTION: HAVE A 10 HOUR YT VIDEO PLAYING AND THE MACRO PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND
